##### Work Package 1: ==Research Design==
---

We are working around one big guiding question. 
- ==How are OS tools transforming Socio-Environmental (SE) research?==
	- In terms of the overall **landscape**.
	- In terms of research **infrastructure**. 
	- In specific **cases of adoption** for FAIR/CARE standards and OS tools.

We intend to connect these three dimensions analytically to provide crucial insights to identify, understand and address capacity gaps and guide our efforts to support FAIR/CARE integration.

### Rationale of our approach
1. We take socio-environmental data as a ==socio-technical construct==, sustained by a series of *top-down* and *bottom-up* data management and stewardship standards and a set of practices linked to them. 
2. Standards and guidelines aim to ==reduce *data friction*== and, with it, narrow down *the costs in time, energy, and attention required simply to collect, check, store, move, receive, and access data* (Edwards, 2010, p. 84).
---
### Rationale of our approach
3. Guidelines also reduce ==metadata friction== by coordinating a network of actors to find, digitize, and combine existing metadata (Edwards, 2010, p. 318).
4. ==Standards== / ==guidelines== promote a shared vision for **specific improvements** in data management and stewardship practices: they act as ==lubricants== where needed (Edwards, 2010, p. 251)

#### A Top-Down logic in data management
 - This processes entail an effort of *making data global*, hence:  "…building complete, coherent, and consistent global data sets from incomplete, inconsistent, and heterogeneous data sources." Edwards (2010, p. 251) 
- ==FAIR guidelines==, for example, aim to *...enhance data reusability with an emphasis on automation in the finding and use of the data*. (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 1). 

---
#### A Bottom-Up logic in data stewardship
 - Each application entails its struggles and digressions from the standards. 
 - Reducing *friction* can "...only work by accepting deviation, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and incompleteness."(Edwards, 2010, p. 252)
 - The role of indigenous/marginalized communities that support open science is invisibilized; supporting open science is a dilemma for them.
- ==CARE Principles== develop as *people– and purpose-oriented to enhance self-determination in communities and complement FAIR's data-centric approach*.

### Integration
We will push our research forward in three parallel "bands."
- ==Band 1: ==Building a **map** for the SE research landscape (informed on results from Band 2 & 3)
- ==Band 2:== Conduct **infrastructure studies** on key technical infrastructure (as detected in Band 2 & 3). 
- ==Band 3:== Conduct **case studies** (that we can locate using inputs from Band 2 & 1).  
---
### Band 1 - Mapping
Through heterogeneous data analysis, modeling and mapping techniques we aim to: 
1. Use available scientific data in repositories to **reporpuse bibliometric data** to map the research landscape of Socio-Environmental research. 
2. Identify and describe the communities adopting OS tools in SE research. 
3. Describe the main transformations over time. 
4. Locate our network within the vast research landscape. 

---
### Band 2 - Infrestructure
Resorting to multi-methods, we will: 
1. Engage with SE projects in the network and identify the tools and data infrastructure they use to carry out their work.
2. Create a comprehensive list of digital infrastructures and resources that are crucial to support the work of SE projects.
3. Conduct an ethnography of infrastructure to analyze and understand how digital infrastructures are organized and utilized in SE projects.

---
### Band 3 - Cases
Building from the relation of specific implementation cases with the standards, we will study three different types of cases: 
1. Cases of failed attempts or criticism of the implementation of FAIR and CARE and controversy[^1(focus on the diversity of stakeholders, colliding values, intersections of scientific, political, and cultural coords., etc.)].
2. Cases where there is confusion about how to integrate FAIR and CARE.
3. Examples of mature integration of FAIR and CARE University of Arizona (Stefanie Russo - Cyber SW).
