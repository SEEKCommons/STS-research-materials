# SEEKCommons 
## Work Package 1: STS Research

---
We are working with one guiding question:
- How are OS tools and practices being incorporated in Socio-Environmental (SE) research?
	- In terms of the overall **institutional landscape**.
	- In terms of **research infrastructure**. 
	- In specific **cases of adoption** for FAIR/CARE standards and OS tools.

We intend to connect these three dimensions analytically to provide crucial insights to identify, understand and address capacity gaps and guide our efforts to support FAIR/CARE integration.

### Rationale of our approach
1. We take socio-environmental data as a socio-technical construct, sustained by a series of *top-down* and *bottom-up* data management and stewardship practices.
2. Standards and guidelines aim to reduce *data friction* and narrow down *the costs in time, energy, and attention required simply to collect, check, store, move, receive, and access data* (Edwards, 2010, p. 84).
3. Empirical from STS research has shown that frictions exist across various levels of technoscientific practice: epistemic cultures, institutional mandates, technical capacity and expertise, and boundary-making practices in the sciences, creating detrimental divisions between service and support personel and scientists.

### Rationale of our approach
3. Guidelines may reduce data and metadata friction by coordinating a network of actors to find, digitize, and combine existing metadata (Edwards, 2010, p. 318). This hypothesis needs to be tested in the context of emergent socio-environmental research.
4. Standards and guidelines promote a shared vision for **specific improvements** in data management and stewardship practices: they can act as lubricants for the sociotechnical infrastructure where needed (Edwards, 2010, p. 251)

#### Top-Down logic in data management
 - This processes entail an effort of *making data global*, hence:  "...building complete, coherent, and consistent global data sets from incomplete, inconsistent, and heterogeneous data sources." Edwards (2010, p. 251) 
- FAIR guidelines, for example, aim to *...enhance data reusability with an emphasis on automation in the finding and use of the data*. (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 1). 

---
#### Bottom-Up logic in data stewardship
 - Each application entails its struggles and digressions from the standards. 
 - Reducing *friction* can "...only work by accepting deviation, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and incompleteness."(Edwards, 2010, p. 252)
 - The role of indigenous/marginalized communities that support open science is invisibilized; supporting open science is a dilemma for them.
- CARE Principles develop as *peopleâ€“ and purpose-oriented to enhance self-determination in communities and complement FAIR's data-centric approach*.

### Framework for integration
We will push our research forward in three parallel "bands."
- Band 1: Building a **map** of the SE institutional landscape
- Band 2: Conduct **infrastructure ethnography** on key technical infrastructure
- Band 3: Conduct **case studies** of SE projects with semi-structured interviews and participant observation in community events, gatherings, and conferences 
---
### Band 1 - Institutional Mapping
Through data analysis and mapping techniques, we aim to:
1. Identify and describe the institutions adopting OS tools in SE research 
2. Locate the network links between community/institutional initiatives
3. Use available data in public repositories and corporate bibliographic reference datasets to map the scientific landscape of SE projects

---
### Band 2 - Infrestructural Study
Resorting to mixed-methods, we will: 
1. Engage with SE projects in the SEEKCommons network and identify the tools and data infrastructure they use to carry out their work
2. Create a comprehensive list of digital infrastructures, resources, and tools that are used to support SE projects
3. Conduct an ethnography of infrastructure to analyze and understand the potentialities and challenges of using OS tools and standards in SE projects

---
### Band 3 - Case Studies
Drawing from our understading of the scientific landscape and the list of existing tools and approaches in OS, we will examine the specific cases where OS tools are use in practice:
1. Cases of failed attempts or refusal to implementation of FAIR and CARE guidelines and principles
2. Cases where there is no information / confusion on how to integrate FAIR/CARE
3. Cases where integration has already been achieved (such as Cyber SW / Stefanie Russo at Arizona State University)
